/**
 * Run the per-connector sandbox contract suite.
 *
 * Every connector's `test/sandbox.test.ts` (see CONNECTOR_GLOB below) is gated on
 * `describe.skipIf(!process.env["NIMBUS_TEST_HARNESS"])`. Before this script that variable
 * was read in 79 places and set in none — no workflow, no script, no documented command —
 * so the suite had no invocation path at all and the exclusion notes that credited it were
 * describing something that never ran.
 *
 * It stays off by default for a real reason, not an oversight: `runSandboxContractTests`
 * forks a probe that opens a REAL connection to the connector's first declared network host
 * (`permissions.network[0]`) to prove the sandbox permits a listed host, and on non-Windows
 * a second probe that proves an unlisted host is refused. That is live outbound traffic to
 * ~79 vendor endpoints, so it belongs behind an explicit opt-in rather than in `bun test`.
 *
 * Consequences worth knowing before reading a red result:
 *   - A host that does not resolve from your network fails as `exit 6` / `exit 2`, which is
 *     an environment result, not a manifest defect. Check the host resolves before filing.
 *   - The unlisted-host probe is skipped on win32 by the SDK, so a Windows-only green run
 *     has proved the positive half of the contract only.
 *
 * Ported from the Nimbus monorepo, where it was retired when the connectors moved here. Its only
 * subject is these connectors' sandbox tests, so leaving it there would have left it scanning a
 * path that no longer exists — and deleting it without porting would have dropped the suite's only
 * invocation path a second time, which is the exact failure its own comment above describes.
 *
 * Env passthrough is explicit because `NIMBUS_TEST_HARNESS=1 bun test …` is a POSIX-shell
 * idiom that is a parse error in PowerShell (Non-Negotiable 5: platform equality).
