 * Node implementation. Exported so it can be tested directly: the suite runs under Bun, so
 * `nimbusSpawn` would otherwise never exercise this branch and it would ship unverified.
 *
 * Two Node APIs are deliberately NOT used, and the reasons are not obvious:
 *
 *  - `spawnSync` blocks the event loop. In a stdio MCP server that must keep answering JSON-RPC —
 *    including an in-flight `elicitation/create` round-trip — a synchronous spawn deadlocks the
 *    consent gate against itself.
 *  - `execFile` caps captured output at a 1 MB `maxBuffer` by default and errors past it. The
 *    `Bun.spawn` path reads stdout uncapped, and `aws logs` / `gcloud logging` JSON routinely
 *    exceeds 1 MB, so `execFile` would be a silent-truncation regression dressed up as a
 *    portability fix.
 *
 * Output is accumulated as raw `Buffer`s and decoded ONCE at the end. Decoding each chunk with
 * `chunk.toString("utf8")` corrupts any multi-byte character that straddles a chunk boundary, and
 * chunk boundaries are a function of pipe timing — so it fails intermittently, on non-ASCII data,
 * in production.
